# Semi-Automatic-Churning-Machine
# 1.Problem statement
    To make a Semi-Automated Churning Machine.
# 2.Objectives of the project: 
     A Semi-Automated Churning Machine designed to perform several types of operations, such as buttermilk making, vegetable chopping and dough kneading, as per required 
     user input. This project is currently in the process of obtaining a Patent.
# 3.Methodology to solve the problem
     First of all I will design Electronic Circuit Using a AVR Microcontroller (Atmega32), 16x2 LCD Display, 4x3 Keypad, 12V Geared Motor, 12V Water Solenoid valve, 5Kg 
     Load cell with HX711 amplifier module and few other electronic component, then I would simulate it on Proteus software. If all is well then I will do physical test 
     on Breadboard or General Purpose Universal PCB.
